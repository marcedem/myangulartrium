                        Artrium is a social community so feel free to post your thoughts, start discussions and be enthusiastic about artworks that inspire you. Your feedback is valuable. Don't hide in the shadows – contribute! Remember, some artists may be at a very early stage in their career, so keep comments constructive. No artholes! Artrium aims for a supportive and positive environment. Artists, please only upload original art. Whether painting, drawing, photography or graffiti, it has to be your own work. Play fair, do not take credit for another person's efforts and look out for one another. All art submitted to Artrium is moderated, but if you spot something amiss, report it and we will investigate. Keep in touch. Follow artrium.me on facebook and instagram for exclusive interviews, featured artworks, news from the art world and artist survival tips. Plus, find out about upcoming events and how to get involved.

                        All artworks submitted to Artrium are individually checked by our team of moderators. But once the artworks go live, it is over to you. Rate, collect and discuss: artists with a high community rating will be showcased in future events, in-depth features and interviews. With your voice, help curate the art of the future.
